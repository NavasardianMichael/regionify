| Related assets   | Same dataset already used in `docs/marketing/reddit/week-04/10-dataisbeautiful-india-gdp.md` and `11-mapporn-india-gdp.md`. Sibling silent `.webm` (no music) exists if a different track is preferred. The separate export-only clip (`demo-video-india-map-export.mp4`) is a different, shorter, silent, portrait file with no embed content — see the note in README.md, not relevant to this upload.                                 |

**Verified by pulling sample frames (`ffmpeg -ss <t> -frames:v 1`)** — the Embed modal frame matches the script exactly: "Public map embed" title, Enable toggle, SEO page title/meta description fields, Trusted origins, Layout, Public Page URL, and the iframe code block, with the cursor-highlight ring on Save. Confirms the file is intact and the storyboard actually plays out as described.

## ⚠️ Before publishing — two things to confirm

1. **Real account name is visible.** The top-right nav shows "Michael Navasardyan" (the real logged-in account) for the entire recording — this is a genuine screen capture, not a synthetic export, so there's no UI chrome to strip. This already matches the founder-disclosure you do on the Reddit/LinkedIn posts, so it's likely fine as-is — flagging it so it's a decision, not an accident. If you'd rather not show it, options are: re-record under a display name that doesn't show your full legal name, or crop the top nav bar out in a re-edit.
2. **Music attribution.** "Cocktail Lounge" by Dyalla is muxed into this file. Same caution as the LinkedIn post's Aylex track: confirm the exact attribution requirement (if any) from wherever this track was sourced before publishing — YouTube's Content ID will flag it automatically if the license requires credit and it's missing, which can get a video muted or blocked after the fact.

## Title — pick ONE

**Primary — outcome-forward (recommended):**

```
Turn a Spreadsheet Into a Live, Embeddable Map (Full Demo)
```

**Backup 1 — literal workflow, matches the LinkedIn post's framing style:**

```
From CSV to Animated Map to Website Embed — Regionify Walkthrough
```

**Backup 2 — how-to phrasing (good for search intent like "how to embed a map on my website"):**

```
How to Turn Regional Data Into an Embeddable Interactive Map
```

Primary leads with the payoff (embeddable live map) rather than the tool name — better for viewers who don't know Regionify yet and are searching around the problem, not the brand.

---

## Description

```
Paste in a spreadsheet of regional data, style it as an animated map, and publish it as a live, embeddable map — no code, no GIS software. This is the whole workflow, unedited except for playback speed.

What happens in this video:
• Pick a country (India) from 200+ built-in region sets
• Paste GDP-per-capita data (2001–2023) into the manual data box, replacing the sample data
• Expand the legend's Ranges panel, add 3 more bins, name and recolor all 6 after World Bank-style income tiers (Low → Very High Income), then normalize
• Play the animation through all 23 years
• Save the project, then open Embed → enable public embed → copy the ready-to-paste iframe code

Data shown: OECD Regional Economy database, GDP by TL2 region (OECD.CFE.EDS:DSD_REG_ECO@DF_GDP), USD PPP-converted, constant prices, 2001–2023.

Made with Regionify (regionify.pro) — I'm the founder. Animated GIF/MP4 export starts at the Explorer tier ($19 once) and public embeds at Chronographer ($39 once); the free Observer tier covers watermarked PNG/JPEG/PDF export and all 200+ region sets.

```

Notes:

- First 3 hashtags (`#Regionify #DataVisualization #ChoroplethMap`) auto-display above the title.
- Unlike the LinkedIn post's hashtag rule ("never use a branded hashtag on your own posts"), YouTube descriptions don't carry the same spam signal for `#Regionify` — it's fine here since this is your own channel, not a third-party community.

## Thumbnail

This is a regular upload, so a custom 1280×720 thumbnail matters for CTR (unlike a Short, which can rely on an auto-picked cover frame).

- **Strongest single frame:** the Embed modal moment (~t=40s) — it's the payoff and the least "generic SaaS demo" looking shot, showing the actual iframe code and public URL.
- **If compositing a custom thumbnail instead:** split-screen the messy-legend-styling moment (left) against the finished animated map (right), with bold text overlay ("Spreadsheet → Live Map"). Same asset-assembly approach as the LinkedIn hero image brief in `docs/marketing/linkedin/post.md`.
- Crop carefully — source is 4:3 (1280×960); a 1280×720 thumbnail needs a vertical crop, not a squeeze/stretch.

Data: OECD Regional Economy database — GDP by TL2 region (OECD.CFE.EDS:DSD_REG_ECO@DF_GDP),
USD PPP-converted, constant prices, 2001–2023.

Made with Regionify (regionify.pro) — I'm the founder. The embed feature (shown at the end)
publishes a read-only, live version of the map as an iframe — same underlying data and legend,
publicly viewable and embeddable on any site.

## Prepared replies

**Q: "Can I actually embed this on my own site, or is that just for the demo?"**

> Real feature — Chronographer tier. Once enabled, you get a public URL and an iframe snippet; the embedded map stays live if you edit the underlying project later. "Allow embedding from any origin" is a toggle — you can restrict it to specific domains instead.

**Q: "What tool is this?"**

> Regionify (regionify.pro) — link in the pinned comment. Free tier covers PNG/JPEG/PDF export and all 200+ built-in region sets; the paid tiers add SVG, time-series/animated export, and public embeds.

**Q: "Why income tiers instead of a smooth color gradient?"**

> Personal preference — wanted to test whether naming the bins (Low/Lower-Middle/Middle/Upper-Middle/High/Very High Income, World Bank-style) reads more clearly at a glance than a raw gradient. Ranges are still normalized to the real 2001–2023 min/max either way.

**Q: "Is the embedded map's data live, or a static snapshot?"**

> It reflects whatever the project currently has — if you edit the data or styling later and save, the public embed updates too. It's not a one-time static export like the PNG/SVG/MP4 options.

**Q: "Does PPP account for regional cost-of-living differences within India?"**

> No — this is PPP at the national conversion rate only, so it doesn't adjust for the fact that, say, Bihar's cost of living is meaningfully lower than Delhi's. Worth flagging as a real limitation of the underlying data.

## Compliance checklist (before hitting Publish)

- [ ] Confirmed the file plays correctly end-to-end (already verified via `ffprobe` + sample frames in this doc, but re-check if the file changes)
- [ ] Decided how to handle the visible real account name in the nav bar (see blocker note above)
- [ ] Confirmed music attribution requirement for "Cocktail Lounge" by Dyalla, added credit to description if required
- [ ] Category set (Howto & Style or Education)
- [ ] "Not made for kids" set
- [ ] Thumbnail picked/composited (1280×720, cropped not stretched from the 4:3 source)
- [ ] UTM link resolves to regionify.pro with the right campaign param
- [ ] Pinned comment ready to paste immediately after publishing
- [ ] Added to a playlist if the channel has (or should start) one, e.g. "Regionify Demos"
- [ ] Double-checked the "Allow embedding from any origin" + public URL shown on screen isn't pointing at a project you'd rather keep private (it's a demo project, but confirm before this goes out publicly)
